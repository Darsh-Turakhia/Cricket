# Cricket
A simple cricket scorecard maintainer in c++.

This is just a basic version of cricket scorecard it just accepts the runs scored off a ball by batting team and then adds it up to the total in both the innings and declares the winner.

To add some more features I have added a coin toss feature as well.

The player names are just for fun and is not displayed anywhere.
